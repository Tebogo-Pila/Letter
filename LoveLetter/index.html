        <h1>My Love,</h1>
        <p>I’ve sat with these words in my heart, turning them over, feeling the weight of what I need to say. And as I write this, I imagine you reading it, your eyes moving over each letter, feeling every emotion I pour into them.</p>

        <p>There’s something sacred about us—something untouchable, undeniable. From the very start, we believed in each other, in this love that felt like it could withstand anything. We promised we’d never leave, never give up, and that no matter what life threw our way, we would always find our way back. I still believe that. And I hope you do, too.</p>

        <p>I know there have been moments where you felt alone when I should have been right there beside you. Pregnancy is a time when love should feel like the safest place, and I should have wrapped you in that security more. I should have been more present, more in tune with your heart, your needs, your unspoken feelings. I see that now, and I need you to know: I am sorry.</p>

        <p>I never want you to feel like your voice isn’t heard, like your emotions are too much to carry alone. You are carrying life—our life, our future—and I should have been carrying you, in every way you needed. If I could go back and rewrite those moments, I would. But what I can do is move forward with the love and commitment you deserve. I promise you, from this moment on, you will never have to wonder where my heart stands.</p>

        <p>I see you, love. The way your eyes light up when we talk about our future, the way you cling to me outside like I’m your safest place. You are my safest place, too. And that’s why I won’t let us get lost in misunderstandings, in silence that keeps us apart. Every dream we’ve ever whispered to each other—our home, our travels, our children—we will build it all, together.</p>

        <p>So let me hold your heart the way you hold mine. Let me be what you need, now and always. You are my love, my forever, my safe place. And I will never stop proving that to you.</p>
