        <h1>My One & Only,</h1>
        <p>There's so much I want to say to you—so much I've been feeling that words can't seem to capture, but I'll try, because you deserve to hear it all.</p>

        <p>First, thank you. Thank you for holding me down when I was at my lowest, for believing in us even when it wasn't easy, and for carrying our baby with a strength and grace which is not easy for many. You've been my anchor, my foundation, and I can never fully express how much I appreciate you for that.</p>

        <p>I've had time to reflect, to really think about what I want— not just for today, but for the rest of our lives.</p>

        <p>And I want you to know, my love, that my intentions for you are far greater than just being your boyfriend. I want to be your partner, your husband, your family. I want to spend my life showing you what true love looks like—how it persists, how it grows stronger through every storm, every joy, every challenge.</p>

        <p>When I look at you, I see my future. I see a future where we have everything we've dreamed of—our trips in that Defender, the Porsche, our quiet moments in Italy, the house we'll build together. And most of all, I see a future where you call me your husband.</p>
        
        <p>You've already made me the luckiest man alive, just by being in my life. Now, I can't wait to spend the rest of my days showing you how much I adore you, how much I will always choose you, and how deeply I want to build our future together.</p>

        <p>You are everything I ever dreamed of, and I will never take that for granted.</p>
        <p>I promise you this: Our love will continue to deepen, and I'll always ensure it reflects the extraordinary woman you are.</p>


        <p>Forever and always,</p>
